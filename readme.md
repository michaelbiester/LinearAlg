# Linear Algebra & related Topics

**Overview**

For various topics in linear algebra I created (and continue to create) `Jupyter` notebooks. 

For me this approach to learning linear algebra works better than just reading books, articles. The notebooks help me to express various concepts in my own words. Being able to include code examples and formulas (`Latex`) I have found extremely useful to get a reasonable grasp of linear algebra. From experience I found learning from textual sources (books, articles) much more efficient than the numerous `You Tube` videos. 

**Motivation**

I am interested in applications which rely heavily on a fairly solid understanding of maths (calculus, linear algebra, Fourier analysis, signal processing).

1) Computer Tomography / Medical Imaging technologies

2) Computer Vision

3) Machine Learning

4) Data analysis / Statistics

## gauss_jordan_elimination.ipynb

discusses `Gauss-Jordan` method to transform matrices.

[gauss_jordan_elimination.pdf]

---

## least_sqares_solutions.ipynb

short review of least squares solution of a matrix equation 

keywords: normal equation, left matrix inverse

[least_sqares_solutions.pdf]

---

## least_squares_problems_1.ipynb

[least_squares_problems_1.pdf]

---

## least_squares_solution_and_svd.ipynb

a first draft of the `SVD` decomposition.

will be deleted in the future ... superseded by other notebooks of `SVD` and its applications.

[least_squares_solution_and_svd.pdf]

---

## lines_and_planes.ipynb

more work on this notebook is required to make it useful.

[lines_and_planes.pdf]

---

## matrix_approximation_svd.ipynb

Some examples how `SVD` is used to approximate a matrix by a `truncated` matrix.

The method is applied to

1) a very simple matrix 

2) an image represented by a matrix, the low rank approximation of the image show that only a moderate number of singular values are required to obtain a good approximation.

## matrix_inverse.ipynb

the definition of the inverse of a square matrix.

1) proof of uniqueness

2) the inverse of a rectangular matrix

    a) left inverse for `tall` matrix

    b) right inverse for `wide` matrix

numerical examples of full inverse, left inverse and right inverse matrices.
